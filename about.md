Hello! I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on health economics and public economics. My work applies tools from mechanism design and econometrics to those areas. I previously worked at the Center for Global Development and earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania.

Let's get in touch! My email is **gzyang4@gmail.com**.
