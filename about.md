Hello! I currently work at CGD, a nonpartisan think tank in D.C. and conduct research in development economics, where I have had the wonderful opportunity to work with [Charles Kenny](https://www.cgdev.org/expert/charles-kenny), [Justin Sandefur](https://www.cgdev.org/expert/justin-sandefur), and [Arvind Subramanian](https://www.arvindsubramanian.org/). I am an incoming first-year PhD student in economics at University of California Santa Barbara, with an interest in global health.

Let's get in touch! My email is **gzyang4@gmail.com**. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamgeorgeyang), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Fp-U810AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), or download my [CV](documents/resume_2022-04-17.pdf).

You can also provide me anonymous feedback [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf53XGT5LnXXOS5kcLwp7RYuEHevfgNayXYWJVdEaJdZVS3Nw/viewform).
