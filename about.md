Hello! Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student in economics at University of California Santa Barbara. I currently work at CGD, a nonpartisan think tank in D.C. and conduct research in development economics, where I have had the wonderful opportunity to work with [Charles Kenny](https://www.cgdev.org/expert/charles-kenny), [Justin Sandefur](https://www.cgdev.org/expert/justin-sandefur), and [Arvind Subramanian](https://www.arvindsubramanian.org/). I also previously helped support [Abby Alpert](https://hcmg.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/alpertab/)'s research at [LDI](https://ldi.upenn.edu/).

I have an interest in global health and have worked at an insurance company, a hospital, and a health startup. Feel free to look me up on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Fp-U810AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamgeorgeyang), take my [CV](documents/resume_2022-04-17.pdf), or email me at `gyang [at] cgdev.org`.

You can also provide me anonymous feedback [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf53XGT5LnXXOS5kcLwp7RYuEHevfgNayXYWJVdEaJdZVS3Nw/viewform).
