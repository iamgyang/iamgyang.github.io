Hello! I am a third-year Economics PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), with research interests in health economics—particularly global health—and public economics. My work applies tools from mechanism design, econometrics, and experimental economics to address questions in these areas.

Previously, I worked at CGD, a nonpartisan think tank in D.C. and conducted research in development economics. I worked with [Charles Kenny](https://www.cgdev.org/expert/charles-kenny), [Justin Sandefur](https://www.cgdev.org/expert/justin-sandefur), and [Arvind Subramanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Subramanian). Before CGD, I worked at UPenn LDI with [Abby Alpert](https://sites.google.com/site/abbyealpert/home). 

Let's get in touch! My email is **gzyang4@gmail.com**. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamgeorgeyang), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Fp-U810AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), or download my [CV](documents/resume_2024_02_07.pdf).
