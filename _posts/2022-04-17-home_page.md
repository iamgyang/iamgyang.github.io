Hello! I’m a first-year PhD student in economics at University of California
Santa Barbara. I currently work at CGD, a nonpartisan thinktank in D.C. and
conduct research in development economics. I am often responsible for Charles
Kenny's Appendix, and also support Justin Sandefur and Arvind Subramanian. I
have an interest in global health and previously have interned at insurance
companies, hospitals, and telemedicine companies.

Feel free to look me up on Google Scholar or Twitter, or take my CV.
