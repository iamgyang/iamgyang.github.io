I wrote a [proof](documents/general_uni_ch_thm.pdf) that generalizes the [universal chord theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_chord_theorem). My proof is over the real numbers, while the original one is over the naturals. I wrote this after being assigned the original theorem on a problem set, so if you see any errors, let me know!
