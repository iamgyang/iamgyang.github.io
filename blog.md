I wrote my first own [original proof](documents/general_uni_ch_thm.pdf) of a generalized version of the [universal chord theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_chord_theorem). My proof is over the real numbers, while the original is over the naturals. I wrote this after being assigned the universal chord theorem on a problem set, so if you see any errors, let me know!
